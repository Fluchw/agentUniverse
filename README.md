## What is agentUniverse?

**agentUniverse is a multi-agent framework based on large language models.** agentUniverse provides you with the flexible and easily extensible capability to build single agents. At its core, agentUniverse features a rich set of multi-agent collaboration mode components (which can be viewed as a Collaboration Mode Factory, or Pattern Factory). These components allow agents to maximize their effectiveness by specializing in different domains to solve problems. agentUniverse also focuses on the integration of domain expertise, helping you seamlessly incorporate domain knowledge into the work of your agents.🎉🎉🎉

**🌈🌈🌈agentUniverse helps developers and enterprises to easily build powerful collaborative agents that perform at an expert level in their respective domains.**

![](docs/guidebook/_picture/agent_universe_framework_resize.jpg)

We encourage you to practice and share different domain Patterns within the community. The framework comes pre-loaded with several multi-agent collaboration mode components that have been validated in real-world industries and will continue to expand in the future. The components that will be available soon include:

* PEER Mode Component: This pattern uses agents with different responsibilities—Plan, Execute, Express, and Review—to break down complex problems into manageable steps, execute the steps in sequence, and iteratively improve based on feedback, enhancing the performance of reasoning and analysis tasks. Typical use cases: Event interpretation, industry analysis.
* DOE Mode Component: This pattern employs three agents—Data-fining, Opinion-inject, and Express—to improve the effectiveness of tasks that are data-intensive, require high computational precision, and incorporate expert opinions. Typical use cases: Financial report generation.

More patterns are coming soon...

Overview: This document provides a detailed introduction to the mechanisms and principles of the PEER multi-agent framework. In the experimental section, scores were assigned across seven dimensions: completeness, relevance, conciseness, factualness, logicality, structure, and comprehensiveness (each dimension has a maximum score of 5 points). The PEER model scored higher on average in each evaluation dimension compared to BabyAGI and demonstrated significant advantages in the dimensions of completeness, relevance, logicality, structure, and comprehensiveness. Additionally, the PEER model achieved a superior rate of 83% over BabyAGI using the GPT-3.5 Turbo (16k) model, and 81% using the GPT-4 model. For more details, please refer to the document.
